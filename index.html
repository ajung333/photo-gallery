							<h2>GILLIE'S</h2>
							<p>Gillie’s is a longtime favorite of locals and Virginia Tech students alike. They serve delicious vegetarian food using produce bought locally and in-house baked bread. Pictured above is my personal favorite dish; Tofu Scramble. It is a seasonal vegetable medley and tofu that is stir fried in a house barbeque sauce with a side of house-made potatoes and bread. </p>

							<h2>BOLLO'S</h2>
							<p>As an avid coffee lover, Bollo’s is one of my favorite coffee shops to visit. Situated right next to campus, Bollo’s offers seating, free Wi-Fi, and prices that won’t break the bank. In addition to the fair-trade organic coffee, they offer a variety of baked goods that they bake in-house.</p>
